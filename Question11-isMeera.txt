Question 11
A Meera array is any array that contains the value 1 if and only if it contains 9.
The array {7,9,0,10,1} is a Meera array because it contains 1 and 9.
The array {6,10,8} is a Meera array because it contains no 1 and no 9.
The array {7,6,1} is not a Meera array because it contains 1 but does not contain a 9.
The array {9,10,0} is not a Meera array because it contains a 9 but does not contain 1.
It is okay if a Meera array contains more than one value 1 and more than one 9.
So the array {1,1,0,8,0,9,9,1} is a Meera array.
Write a function named isMeera that returns 1 if it's array argument is a Merra array
and returns 0 otherwise.
If you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature is int isMeera(int[] a)
