Question 12
A Bean array is defined to be an integer array where for every value n in the array,
there is also an element 2n, 2n+1 or n/2 in the array.

for example {4,9,8} is a Bean array because for 4,8 is present, for 9, 4 is present, for 8, 4 is present.
Other Bean arrays include {2,2,5,11,23}, {7,7,3,6} and {0}
The array {3,8,4} is not a Bean array because of the value 3 which requires that the array contains
either the value 6, 7 or 1 and none of these values are in the array.
Write a function named isBean that returns 1 if it's array argument is a Bean array,
otherwise it returns a 0.
if you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature is int isBean(int[] a)
