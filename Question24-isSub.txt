Question 24
A Sub Array is defined to be an array in which each element is greater than sum of all
elements after that. see example below:
{13,6,3,2} is a sub array. Note that 13 > 6+3+2, 6 > 3+2, 3>2.
{11,5,3,2} is NOT a sub array. Note that 5 is not greater than 3+2.
Write a function named isSub that returns 1 if its array argument is a Sub array. otherwise it returns 0.
if you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature is: int isSub(int[] a)
